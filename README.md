# wvs-nz

A social sciences research project with [@desirejam](https://github.com/desirejam) and [@Xiner072](https://github.com/Xiner072).

We examine New Zealanders' responses to the 2019 (Wave 7) [World Values Survey](https://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/). [Rendered output is available](output/).

# Broad aims (to be refined)

* Which factors have a greater effect on Happiness and Well-Being: A person's Security, Religious Values, or Demographics?
* Which factors have a greater effect on Ethical Values and Norms: A person's Religious Values, or Demographics? 
* Do Religious Values affect a person's Social Values, Attitudes & Stereotypes?
* How would economic values affect people's attitude towards corruptionï¼Œor science&technology?
* Do rural people hold different core values to city people? Specifically, which values are most differentially expressed between the city/rural groups? Do these hold after correcting for age/sex differences between the populations?
* Does the source of people's news affect their tolerance for out-groups (ie the "other")?
