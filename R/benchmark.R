#' ## Age
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#' The WVS sampling frame was the NZ electoral roll. Therefore, people under 18
#' have been systematically excluded from the survey. We need to do the same to the
#' census data for comparability.

#+ age-comparison, fig.cap = "KDE for age distributions for whole population and WVS respondents."
# Combine the WVS and census datasets for plotting.
# Expand the census summary into individual rows (all five million):
census_age_expanded <- census_age %>%

  with(rep(age, n))

# Denote the source of each observation in the combined dataframe.

#' These appear to be different distributions. Test more formally with
#' Kolmogorov-Smirnov test:

ks.test(wvs_age$age, census_age_expanded)

#' The distribution of ages of survey respondents does not match the population,
#' even considering the removal of under-18s. The age distribution of
#' respondents is somewhat shifted to the right compared to the population -
#' they are older than expected if they were a representative sample.
#'
#' ## Sex
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#' Have males and females responded to the survey in the same proportions
#' as they occur in the population?

#- sex-comparison, fig.cap = "Sex proportions in census and survey datasets."

#' These appear to be different distributions. Test more formally with a
#' one-sample test of proportions, treating the census data as population
#' proportion:

prop.test(x = t(wvs_sex_tab$n),
          p = census_sex_tab$freq[1])

#' The sample sex proportions are not representative of the population. Females
#' are over-represented in the survey responses.

#' ## Immigration and birthplace
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#' Did immigrants to New Zealand respond to the survey at the same rate they
#' exist in the population?
