#' # Datasets

#' The dataset in use here is the [New Zealand 2018 Census totals by topic â€“
#' national highlights
#' (updated)](https://www.stats.govt.nz/information-releases/2018-census-totals-by-topic-national-highlights-updated).
census_data_dir <- "data/2018-Census-totals-by-topic-national-highlights"

#' Load all of the census highlights into a list of dataframes and perform data

nzl_coded <- readRDS(here("data", "nzl_coded.RDS"))

#' # Checks for representativeness

#' ## Age
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#' The WVS sampling frame was the NZ electoral roll. Therefore, people under 18
#' have been systematically excluded from the survey. We need to do the same to the
#' census data for comparability.

#+ age-comparison, fig.cap = "KDE for age distributions for whole population and WVS respondents."
# Combine the WVS and census datasets for plotting.
# Expand the census summary into individual rows (all five million):
census_age_expanded <- census_age %>%
  filter(age >= 18) %>%
  with(rep(age, n))

# Denote the source of each observation in the combined dataframe.
combo_age <- rbind(
  cbind(wvs_age, data_source = "WVS"),
  data.frame(age = census_age_expanded, data_source = "Census")
)

ggplot(combo_age, aes(age, fill = data_source)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 1/2)

#' These appear to be different distributions. Test more formally with
#' Kolmogorov-Smirnov test:
ks.test(wvs_age$age, census_age_expanded)

#' The distribution of ages of survey respondents does not match the population,
#' even considering the removal of under-18s. The age distribution of
#' respondents is somewhat shifted to the right compared to the population -
#' they are older than expected if they were a representative sample.

#'
#' ## Sex
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#' Have males and females responded to the survey in the same proportions
#' as they occur in the population?

#- sex-comparison, fig.cap = "Sex proportions in census and survey datasets."
census_sex_tab <- census_sex %>%
  select(sex = Sex, n) %>%
  add_freq()

wvs_sex_tab <- wvs_sex %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  count(sex) %>%
  add_freq()

# Combine and plot
combo_sex <- combine_sets(census_sex_tab, wvs_sex_tab)
comparison_barplot(combo_sex, sex)

#' These appear to be different distributions. Test more formally with a
#' one-sample test of proportions, treating the census data as population
#' proportion:
prop.test(x = t(wvs_sex_tab$n),
          p = census_sex_tab$freq[1])

#' The sample sex proportions are not representative of the population. Females
#' are over-represented in the survey responses.

#'
#' ## Education
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#' Does education level differ between the sample and the census population? It
#' is difficult to directly compare, as the datasets code different education
#' levels. So, we code to secondary vs. post-secondary.
#' 

#- education-comparison, fig.cap = "Education proportions in census and survey datasets."
# Code both census and wvs datasets to binary for post-secondary education.
census_educ_tab <-  census_education %>%
  transmute(post_school = case_when(Code == "00" ~ FALSE,
                                    as.integer(Code) %in% 2:10 ~ TRUE),
            n) %>%
  count(post_school) %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  add_freq()

wvs_educ_tab <- wvs_education %>%
  mutate(education = as.integer(education),
         post_school = case_when(education <= 4 ~ FALSE,
                                 education > 4 ~ TRUE)) %>%
  count(post_school) %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  add_freq()

# Combine and plot:
combo_educ <- combine_sets(census_educ_tab, wvs_educ_tab)
comparison_barplot(combo_educ, post_school) +
  scale_fill_discrete(labels = c("Secondary", "Post-secondary"))

#' Once again, these look to be markedly different distributions. We can test:
prop.test(x = t(wvs_educ_tab$n),
          p = census_educ_tab$freq[1])

#' The survey sample is not representative. The survey respondents are more
#' likely to have completed post-secondary education compared to the general
#' population.

#'
#' ## Immigration and birthplace
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#' Did immigrants to New Zealand respond to the survey at the same rate they
#' exist in the population? Given that the survey sampling frame is drawn from
#' the New Zealand electoral roll, which comprises only citizens, it seems
#' unlikely that immigrants are well-represented in the survey respondents.
#'
#' The census captures the names of all countries of birth; however the survey
#' only records New Zealand, United Kingdom and Other. We therefore recode the
#' census data to match this scheme.

wvs_birth_tab <- wvs_birth %>%
  count(country) %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  add_freq() %>%
  arrange(freq)

# Combine various census countries-of-origin into United Kingdom level:
census_birth_tab <- census_birth %>%
  mutate(country = case_when(as.integer(Code) %in% c(0, 9999) ~ NA_character_,
                             Birthplace == "New Zealand" ~ "New Zealand",
                             Birthplace %in% c("England",
                                               "Scotland",
                                               "Northern Ireland",
                                               "Wales",
                                               "Channel Islands",
                                               "Isle of Man",
                                               "Gibraltar",
                                               "United Kingdom (not further defined)")
                             ~ "United Kingdom",
                             TRUE ~ "Other")) %>% 
  count(country) %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  add_freq() %>%
  arrange(freq)

# Combine and plot:
combo_birth <- combine_sets(census_birth_tab, wvs_birth_tab)
comparison_barplot(combo_birth, factor_col = country)

#' These again appear to be different distributions. We can check formally:
birth_stat <- chisq.test(x = wvs_birth_tab$n, p = census_birth_tab$freq)
birth_stat$expected
birth_stat$observed
birth_stat

#' Once again, we find that the survey sample is not representative of the
#' population. Native-born New Zealanders and those born in the UK are slightly
#' over-represented in the sample, while those with other origins are
#' under-represented.
