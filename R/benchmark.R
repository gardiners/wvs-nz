#' ## Age
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#' The WVS sampling frame was the NZ electoral roll. Therefore, people under 18
#' have been systematically excluded from the survey. We need to do the same to the
#' census data for comparability.

#+ age-comparison, fig.cap = "KDE for age distributions for whole population and WVS respondents."

#' The distribution of ages of survey respondents does not match the population,
#' even considering the removal of under-18s. The age distribution of
#' respondents is somewhat shifted to the right compared to the population -
#' they are older than expected if they were a representative sample.

#'

#' Have males and females responded to the survey in the same proportions
#' as they occur in the population?

#'
#' ## Education
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#' Does education level differ between the sample and the census population? It
#' is difficult to directly compare, as the datasets code different education
#' levels. So, we code to secondary vs. post-secondary.
#' 

#- education-comparison, fig.cap = "Education proportions in census and survey datasets."
# Code both census and wvs datasets to binary for post-secondary education.
census_educ_tab <-  census_education %>%
  transmute(post_school = case_when(Code == "00" ~ FALSE,
                                    as.integer(Code) %in% 2:10 ~ TRUE),
            n) %>%

#' Once again, these look to be markedly different distributions. We can test:
prop.test(x = t(wvs_educ_tab$n),
          p = census_educ_tab$freq[1])

#' The survey sample is not representative. The survey respondents are more
#' likely to have completed post-secondary education compared to the general
#' population.

#'
#' ## Immigration and birthplace
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#' Did immigrants to New Zealand respond to the survey at the same rate they
#' exist in the population? Given that the survey sampling frame is drawn from
#' the New Zealand electoral roll, which comprises only citizens, it seems
#' unlikely that immigrants are well-represented in the survey respondents.
#'
#' The census captures the names of all countries of birth; however the survey
#' only records New Zealand, United Kingdom and Other. We therefore recode the
#' census data to match this scheme.

# Combine various census countries-of-origin into United Kingdom level:

                             Birthplace %in% c("England",
                                               "Scotland",
                                               "Northern Ireland",
                                               "Wales",
                                               "Channel Islands",
                                               "Isle of Man",
                                               "Gibraltar",
                                               "United Kingdom (not further defined)")
                             ~ "United Kingdom",
                             TRUE ~ "Other")) %>% 
  count(country) %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  add_freq() %>%
  arrange(freq)

# Combine and plot:
combo_birth <- combine_sets(census_birth_tab, wvs_birth_tab)
birth_plot <- comparison_barplot(combo_birth, factor_col = country) +
  scale_fill_discrete("Birthplace:",
                      labels = c("NZ", "Other", "UK")) +
  labs(subtitle = "Distribution of birthplaces")

educ_plot + birth_plot +
  plot_annotation("Education and birthplace distributions (2018 census and World Values Survey)")

#' These again appear to be different distributions. We can check formally:
birth_stat <- chisq.test(x = wvs_birth_tab$n, p = census_birth_tab$freq)
birth_stat$expected
birth_stat$observed
birth_stat

#' Once again, we find that the survey sample is not representative of the
#' population. Native-born New Zealanders and those born in the UK are slightly
#' over-represented in the sample, while those with other origins are
#' under-represented.
