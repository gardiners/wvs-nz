#' These estimates seem to be extremely unstable: re-training the random forest
#' yields a new set of important predictors each time. However, with repeated
#' runs, a few predictors repeatedly float to the top: Q162, Q126 ("Hard to
#' say"), Q213, ("Would never do"), Q217 ("Would never do"), Q218 ("Would never
#' do"), Q286 ("Spent some savings and borrowed money"), Q173 ("An atheist".)
#' 
#' These are:
#' 
#' * Q126: Immigration increases the risks of terrorism ("Hard to say").
#' * Q162: It is not important for me to know about science in my daily life.
#' * Q173: Independently of whether you attend religious services or not, would
#' you say you areâ€¦? ("An atheist")
#' * Q213: Political actions: donating to a group or campaign ("Would never do")
#' * Q217: Political actions using the internet: Searching information about
#' politics and political events ("Would never do")
#' * Q218: Political actions using the internet: Signing an electronic petition
#' ("Would never do")
#' * Q286:  During the past year, did your family ("Spent some savings and borrowed money")
